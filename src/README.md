About the project

This is a small program that works with different types of vehicles.
There is one main class called Vehicle, and three subclasses: Car, Motorcycle, and Truck.
There is also a Driver class so each vehicle can have a driver.

How it works

Each vehicle can:

start the engine

show its info

stop the engine

In the Main file, I create a car, a motorcycle, and a truck, give them drivers, and print everything to the console.

How to run

In the folder with all .java files, run:

javac *.java
java Main


You will see the output of the program.

What was used

inheritance (all subclasses extend Vehicle)

abstract methods

method overriding

Driver object inside Vehicle

an array with different vehicle types

Summary

The task shows how inheritance makes code simpler.
Shared things go into the Vehicle class, and each subclass has its own behavior.
It helped understand how abstract classes and overriding work.
